## Overview

This repository contains novel approaches based on the **ergodicity metric** introduced in the paper:

> **"Metrics for Ergodicity and Design of Ergodic Dynamics for Multi-Agent Systems"**  
> George Mathew and Igor MeziÄ‡

These methods extend ergodic control techniques for trajectory optimization and spatial coverage, with potential applications in robotics, exploration, and autonomous systems.
