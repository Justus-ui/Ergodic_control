## Overview

This repository presents novel approaches based on the **ergodicity metric** introduced in the paper:

> **"Metrics for Ergodicity and Design of Ergodic Dynamics for Multi-Agent Systems"**  
> George Mathew and Igor MeziÄ‡  
> [Read the paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016727891000285X?fr=RR-2&ref=pdf_download&rr=9442fb44dae4e522)

These methods extend ergodic control techniques for trajectory optimization and spatial coverage, with potential applications in robotics, exploration, and autonomous systems.
